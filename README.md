AppStory: Tittle-LibraryApp
This applications is going to serve all readers of a public library. A user will have to log in with his/her e-mail and will have access to all books in the library with several options: he/she will be able to search for a book and see if there is any copy available. If there is, the user has the option to "reserve" it for, let's say 6 hours. He/she has to go and take the book anytime during those 6 hours, otherwise the reservation will expire. Once a borrowing was made, it is automatically added to the user's list which can be checked using the app (or the user can add it to his/her list of borrowings with all the details (start date, end date, title, auther, unique number, coments)). User will be allowed to extend the time for a borrowing thru this application. A notification will be send with 2 days before the ending date for a borrowing (probably a mail). Also if the user does not return the books in time, they will be added to delayed list with the delay time and the fee. If for a book, there is no copy available, the user can add it to a waiting list and he will be notified when someone returns a copy.
